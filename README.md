# DSA BOOTCAMP 
## Data Structures and Algorithms and Competitive Programming

### Day 2: 
- **Linked List**
- **Tree**
- **Graph**
- **Bit Manipulation**

### Linked List
- A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

### Tree
- A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

### Graph
- A graph is a data structure that consists of the following two components:
    - A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
    - A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not the same as (v, u) in case of a directed graph(di-graph). The pair of the form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.

### Bit Manipulation
- Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or binary digits. It is a fast and simple action, directly supported by the processor, and is used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations.


## Competitive Programming
- Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Competitive programming is recognized and supported by several multinational software and Internet companies, such as Google and Facebook. There are several organizations who host programming competitions on a regular basis.
